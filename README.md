We make simple ATM machine using Java programming , the code would simulate basic ATM functionalities like account balance checking, deposits, withdrawals without any external libraries or databases. Here’s a description of how to structure and approach this program in plain Java:
. Attributes: accountNumber, pin, and balance are essential data fields. The accountNumber and pin fields handle identification and security, while balance stores the current funds.
Methods:-
validatePin(int inputPin): Checks if the entered PIN matches the account's PIN.
getBalance(): Returns the current balance in the account.
deposit(double amount): Adds a specified deposit amount to the account’s balance.
withdraw(double amount): Reduces the account balance by the withdrawal amount if there are sufficient funds, returning a boolean indicating success or failure.Menu Operations:
Check Balance: Calls the getBalance() method of the Account class to display the current balance.
Deposit: Prompts the user for a deposit amount, then updates the balance using the deposit() method.
Withdraw: Prompts the user for a withdrawal amount and attempts to deduct the amount using the withdraw() method. It verifies funds availability to prevent overdrafts.
Error Handling:-
To create a smooth user experience, the program includes basic error handling:

Invalid Input: Prevents users from entering negative amounts for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Insufficient Funds: Displays a warning when a user tries to withdraw or transfer more money than is available.
Invalid Account: Informs the user if they attempt to authenticate with incorrect account details
Example Program Flow:-
User enters their account number and PIN.
If authentication is successful, the ATM menu displays:
Check Balance
Deposit Funds
Withdraw Funds
Transfer Funds
Exit
User selects an option and follows the prompts for any necessary details.
The program performs the selected action and returns to the main menu.
The session ends when the user selects "Exit."
